I used to keep a list of words I planned to look up and also manually added to Anki to memorize. After a while I decided to automate the process so I made this. It is a personal and complementary tool for Anki that I use to:
  - get definitions and examples from Cambridge Dictionary
  - keep track of words that are added to Anki
  - add new words to Anki
